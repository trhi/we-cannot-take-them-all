  //We Cannot Take Them All

  //This text is a very slightly modified version of what appears in:
  //Carens, Joseph (2015) The Ethics of Immigration. London: Oxford University Press.
  //This excerpt is an imaginary list of reasons for why the general public
  //in America may have been opposed to the idea of admitting Jewish refugees
  //during World War Two. The idea is that these types of rationalisations
  //may have surfaced during public discourse at the time, even by people who
  //considered themselves only mildly opposed to the idea of admitting
  //refugees.

  //Carens' purpose with presenting these generalisations is to call our
  //attention to how, in the light of what was revealed in the aftermath of the
  //war of the full extent of the unacceptable and deadly conditions and
  //discrimination to which Jews were subject under the Nazi regime,
  //the concerns raised in these statements become blatantly disproportionate
  //and meaningless to the extent of the suffering and true peril which the
  //people fleeing Nazi persecution were facing at their origin countries.

  //Carens presents us with these statements so that we may reflect on the one
  //hand, on whether we can identify this very same type of reasoning emerging
  //in public discourse related to contemporary "refugee situations", and
  //furthermore, to play out the thought experiment of: what if we later come
  //to understand a more full picture of the suffering of the people who have
  //chosen to distance themselves physically from the situations that produced
  //their misery? Will these arguments continue to hold even the slightest
  //degree of reason or moral weight, all other aspects considered?

  //The purpose of translating Carens' text into a generative piece which
  //relies heavily on speech interaction is twofold: On the one hand, we utilise
  //synthetic speech to invoke the idea of various countries and nationalities:
  //whether familiar to us or not, a foreign accent will invoke a sense of another
  //country. Meanwhile, it is also humorous to be exposed to a synthetic voice
  //speaking in a heavy accent, which in turn makes one more likely to engage
  //further with the piece. Moreover, the user cannot simply click to interact,
  //but must use their very voice to tell the system "I am from __country__".
  //Most will begin by choosing their own country, as this is the most natural
  //statement to make. However, in order to further engage with the piece,
  //one will begin to say "I am from __another country__ " in order to hear
  //what that accent sounds like. One will choose accents with which one is
  //familiar, or perhaps "play through them all" just for the fun of it.

  //Meanwhile, amidst this play, the user inevitably is exposed to a mantra,
  //which always begins with these three sentences:
  //What is happening to the others is too bad, but it's not our fault. We
  //cannot take them all. We have our own problems.

  //Through the humour of the very human factor of linguistic accents in
  //spoken english, and through the fun of seeing their own speech transcribed
  //onto the screen, the user is transported into the midst of the multifaceted
  //discourse on whether or not societies should grant refuge to fellow humans
  //in need.

  var carensGeneralisation = [
    "What is happening to the Jews is too bad, but it's not our fault. We cannot take them all. " +
    "We have our own problems. ",
    "If we take in all the Jews who want to come, we will be overwhelmed. " +
    "There are simply too many of them. ",
    "Besides, while Jews may be subject to discrimination and occasional acts of violence, things are not as bad as their advocacy groups say. " +
    "They exaggerate the problem. ",
    "Many of the Jews just want better economic opportunities than they have at home. " +
    "The ones who manage to make it to North America cannot be among the worst off because they have enough economic resources to cross the Atlantic. ",
    "Times are tough here. " +
    "We have an obligation to look out for our own needy first. ",
    "A large infux of Jews could be a cultural and political threat. " +
    "They don't share our religious traditions or our democratic values. ",
    "Some of them are communists and pose a basic security threat, but it's hard to be sure which ones, so it's better not to let any of them in. ",
    "Many of them have shown that they don't respect the law because they have purchased forged documents, hired smugglers to transport them illegally, and lied to our immigration officials. ",
    "Admitting Jewish refugees does not help to address the underlying problems that have given rise to the Nazi phenomenon."

    // ME is described through two simple parameters:
    // 1) the words and concepts that I use to describe The Other,
    // and
    // 2) what it is that makes me scared about them.

    // The way that the refugee is described hinges on three important elements:
    // 1) what it is that they are physically distancing themselves from,
    // 2) the barriers,
    // physical as well as invisible,
    // that they face as they attempt to project themselves
    // away from their source of misery and towards their safe haven,
    // and
    // 3) the way we describe what they perceive as safety/a safe place.

    //Although the original text is by Joseph Carens, the creation of these
    //alternate, poetic, abstract and imaginative ways to generalise these five
    //aspects describing refugees and "Me" in any refugee situation, can be
    //understood as the creative and literary authorship of me.

    //Also, and importantly: the original idea of thinking through these
    //hypothetical reasonings and generalisations related to
    //any refugee situation in the world, is also of the authorship of Joseph
    //Carens. These ideas are based on empirical observations.
