"We Cannot Take Them All. This text is a very slightly modified version of what appears in: Carens, Joseph (2015) The Ethics of Immigration. London: Oxford University Press. This excerpt is an imaginary list of reasons for why the general public in America may have been opposed to the idea of admitting Jewish refugees during World War Two. The idea is that these types of rationalisations may have surfaced during public discourse at the time, even by people who considered themselves only mildly opposed to the idea of admitting refugees. Carens' purpose with presenting these generalisations is to call our attention to how, in the light of what was revealed in the aftermath of the war of the full extent of the unacceptable and deadly conditions and discrimination to which Jews were subject under the Nazi regime, the concerns raised in these statements become blatantly disproportionate and meaningless in comparison to the extent of the suffering and peril which the people fleeing Nazi persecution were facing at their origin countries. Carens presents us with these statements so that we may reflect on the one hand, on whether we can identify this very same type of reasoning emerging in public discourse related to contemporary 'refugee situations', and furthermore, to play out the thought experiment of: what if we later come to understand a more full picture of the suffering of the people who have chosen to distance themselves physically from the situations that produced their misery? Will these arguments continue to hold even the slightest degree of reason or moral weight, all other aspects considered? The purpose of translating Carens' text into a generative piece which relies heavily on speech interaction is twofold: On the one hand, we utilise synthetic speech to invoke the idea of various countries and nationalities: whether familiar to us or not, a foreign accent will invoke a sense of another country. Meanwhile, it is also humorous to be exposed to a synthetic voice speaking in a heavy accent, which in turn makes one more likely to engage further with the piece. Moreover, the user cannot simply click to interact, but must use their very voice to tell the system 'I am from some country'. Most will begin by choosing their own country, as this is the most natural statement to make. However, in order to further engage with the piece, one will begin to say 'I am from __another country__ '' in order to hear what that accent sounds like. One will choose accents with which one is familiar, or perhaps 'play through them all' just for the fun of it. Meanwhile, amidst this play, the user inevitably is exposed to a mantra, which always begins with these three sentences: What is happening to the others is too bad, but it's not our fault. We cannot take them all. We have our own problems. Through the humour of the very human factor of linguistic accents in spoken english, and through the playfulness of seeing their own speech transcribed onto the screen, the user is transported into the midst of the multifaceted discourse on whether or not societies should grant refuge to fellow humans in need."
