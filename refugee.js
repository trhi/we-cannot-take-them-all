// The way that the refugee is described hinges on two important elements:
// 1) what it is that they are physically distancing themselves from,
// 2) the barriers to their liberation,
// physical as well as invisible,
// that they face as they attempt to project themselves
// away from their source of misery and towards their safe haven,
