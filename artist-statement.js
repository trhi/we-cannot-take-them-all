"The statements used here are a modified and extended version of what appears in: Carens, Joseph (2015) The Ethics of Immigration. London: Oxford University Press, Page 193. These statements are an imaginary list of reasons for why the general public (in America) may have been opposed to the idea of admitting Jewish refugees during World War Two. In the aftermath of the war, the full extent of the holocaust was revealed. If human life and security is at stake, sovereign nations should be morally obliged to permit the entry of non-nationals. This is the moral groundwork of the United Nations 1951 Refugee Convention."
